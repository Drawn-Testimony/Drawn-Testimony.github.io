        "text": "On October 2, 1943, eight-year-old Steen Metz and his parents were arrested in their home in Odense, Denmark, and deported to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. What followed were eighteen months of hunger, brutality, and loss—including the death of his father from starvation. Of the 15,000 children who passed through Theresienstadt, fewer than 1,500 survived. Steen was one of them. For decades, like many Holocaust survivors, Steen kept his experiences private. But in 2011, he was ready to share his story through his memoir, A Danish Boy in Theresienstadt. Now, we retell Steen's journey through an interactive visual experience, where hand-drawn illustrations guide you through his memories. This isn't just a story to read—it's a story to witness, to explore, and to remember.",
